            <p>
                After nearly 10 years as a doctor, while on the hunt for a new challenge,
                I discovered a passion for coding and software development.
                I hope to use my previously honed skills in <span className="emphasis">problem solving, collaboration, communication and data interpretation</span>
                to bring a unique perspective to the tech industry.
                After embarking on an intensive 4 month coding bootcamp at <span className="emphasis"><a href="https://io-academy.uk/">iO Academy</a></span> in Bath, UK,
                I am well versed in the use of <span className="emphasis">PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript/Typescript</span> for full stack development.
                Please have a look through some of my projects and get in contact if you'd like to connect!
            </p>
